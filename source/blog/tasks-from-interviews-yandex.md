A lot of companies provide interviewers with some programming tasks to solve before face-to-face or Skype interview with their employes. Sometimes they could ask you to solve some task during the interview online. I think many of specialists nowadays know that and looking for such usual tasks while preparation to interview.

I want to share some tasks that I've received before Skype interview in big company called Yandex on position of JavaScript developer. Of course my solution may not be that best one, if you have any concerns about it feel free to add yours in the comments to this post.

## Task 1
Display to browser developer consolethe phrase: "I can count: 1, 2, 3" without using digits and property `length` in your code. Few variants решения will be a plus.

## Task 2

## Task 3
